Generally, bot is subscription service. As long as you have subscription valid, you are able to use bot.
Users who purchased subscription must be able to automatically access bots.
Subscription must limit how many hours per month you are able to run the bot.

Firstly, only one bot will be provided - MassDMbot. Proxies, scraping followers and etc. must be provided by service.
User will only input username:password of accounts and messages to use with them.

After getting creds and messages from User, bot must save them in settings file and send this file to user, so user won't need to need to enter data all the time he needs to run bot.

As bot is running campaings, following parameters must be settable(as for MassDMbot):
 - Speed of DMing
 - Target
 - Logs
 - Messages

Also, user must be able to see:
 - how many DMed
 - how many ToDM
